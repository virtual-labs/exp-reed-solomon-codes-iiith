### Aim of the experiment
The aim of this experiment is to introduce students to the concepts of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes and the encoding of one such code called the Reed-Solomon (RS) code. RS codes are widely used for error control in communication and storage systems since they have optimal error-correcting capabilities with a field size nearly equal to the length of the code, and they are easy to implement as they are constructed based on evaluating polynomials with coefficients from the finite field.

The structure of the experiment is as follows: 
* MDS codes 
* Encoding of RS codes
